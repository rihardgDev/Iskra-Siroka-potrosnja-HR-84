Iskra's HR-84 home computer from Slovenia (Yugoslavia)

In Iskra's Wide Consumer Division, they developed the HR-84 home computer in the hope of making money from the '2000 computers' project. It was made on the basis of a self-build plan for the Abakus home computer. They used an 8-bit Motorola 6809 microprocessor with a very modest 16-32 KB of RAM and 16 KB of ROM. The entire system was made on three printed circuits, and it also allowed for arbitrary expansion via an open bus, as well as a pseudo graphic display on a screen or TV. Usually, one of Iskra's black-and-white televisions was added in addition to the computer and the Yugoslav keyboard. The computer was programmed in the Basic language and apparently had some programs attached on cassettes. Of course, there was no money to start the production of computers, but nevertheless, in the light of the big business, they promised 500 computers for schools by the end of the year. In the fall of 1984, as an advertising ploy, Iskra carried out trial production and donated the first 100 computers to schools and a few other institutions, but then the project was soon abandoned.
